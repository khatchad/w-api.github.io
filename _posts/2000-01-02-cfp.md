# Call for Papers

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are an essential mechanism for software reuse. However, over the past two decades, many researchers have shown inherent problems with APIs, such as providing useful documentation for proper use, detecting correct usage patterns or wrong usages, and migrating between API versions. While these efforts have advanced the state of the art, most of these problems still exist today. We believe it is time to reflect and compare experiences from different perspectives and to come up with new solutions to the above challenges. 

The first International Workshop on Improving API Use and Support (APItude) provides a venue for researchers and practitioners to come together and discuss the open challenges that API users face. Improving the current state of APIs combines different research areas such as mining software repositories, program analysis, HCI, software evolution, and software documentation. The goal of the workshop is to identify the current open challenges in the area and define a roadmap for innovative solutions, even in the face of poor documentation and evolution. These solutions can eventually also be helpful to API designers themselves.

## Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* API quality metrics
* API usage patterns
* API misuse detection
* API documentation
* API re-design
* API evolution and migration
* Leveraging different sources of data to perform any of the above tasks
* Suitable representations for usage patterns
* User perspectives of API usage and evolution
* Designer perspectives of API design and evolution
* Negative experiences (what did not work)
* Identification of open challenges and proposed solutions
* Synergies between API challenges and other research areas  

## Submission Information

APItude 2017 invites contributions in the form of **4-page papers** from both researchers and practitioners, as well as **talk abstracts** from practitioners. Submissions can be research papers, practice papers, position papers, or experience reports. All submissions should describe unpublished work and must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. Submissions are peer-reviewed and accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings.
