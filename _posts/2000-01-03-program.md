## Session 3: API Evolution

Session Chair
: Annie Ying

2:00 - 2:45
: *"API Evolution and Migration at Google"*
: Industry talk by Hyrum Wright (Google)
: **Abstract:** Googleâ€™s 30,000 engineers actively maintain 2 billion lines of source code in a single source repository. Typical software is built and released from head. Within Google, no individual API is considered immutable, and dedicated teams are responsible for improving APIs and migrating API users to newer versions. At Google-scale---tens or hundreds of thousands of symbol references---automated techniques are required to provide high confidence in migration correctness and safety, while allowing API maintainers the ability to make advances. 
: In this talk, I'll discuss how Google engineers evolve and maintain current APIs to prevent interfaces from calcifying. I'll discuss the reasons we undertake large-scale API migrations, and some of the tools we use to do so. I'll also present some of the outstanding problems we face when doing API migrations, and how we are trying to scale the process even further.
